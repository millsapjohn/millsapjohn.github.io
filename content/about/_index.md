title = "About Me"
+++

I'm a civil engineer by trade (licensed Professional Engineer in Texas). I work in the drainage field, primarily on public infrastructure projects.

I'm inherently curious, and enjoy making the effort to get the most out of the software I use; this leads to me spending a lot of time configuring things how I like them, and inevitably finding the limits of what's possible "as is." I taught myself how to code (poorly) so I could write plugins for the software I use, and extend those limits!

Check out my [GitHub page](https://github.com/millsapjohn) to take a look at some of my projects, and read my [blog](@/blog/_index.md) for musings about my development environment, geospatial programming, or anything else that comes to my mind.
