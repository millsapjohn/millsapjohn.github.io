Check out my [GitHub page](https://github.com/millsapjohn) to take a look at some of my projects, and read my [blog](@/blog/_index.md) for musings about my development environment, geospatial programming, or anything else that comes to my mind.

All of my public projects can be found on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/millsapjohn). A few worth highlighting:

[geofaker](https://github.com/millsapjohn/geofaker) - a Python library for generating fake geospatial data. This project is in its infancy, but I plan on focusing heavily on it in the next few months.

[Nushell Scripts](https://github.com/millsapjohn/nuscripts) - my collection of nushell scripts. Mostly convenience-related functionality.

[QGIS Project Setup Plugin](https://github.com/millsapjohn/qgis_project_setup) - my first QGIS plugin. Sets project variables, manages connections, etc.

[QGIS Macros](https://github.com/millsapjohn/qgis_macros) - my QGIS macros. They interact with the Project Setup Plugin in some ways that I think really expands QGIS functionality.

[QGIS CivilTools](https://github.com/millsapjohn/qgis_civiltools) - my attempt to bring CAD tools to QGIS. In its infancy, this will be a huge project and won't reach maturity for a long time.

[QGIS Parameter History](https://github.com/millsapjohn/qgis_paramhist) - a better processing history plugin. Shows history in a more-readable format, and allows users to re-open an algorithm with the previous parameters pre-loaded.
